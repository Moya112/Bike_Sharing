# Bike_Sharing

## Software
- Pandas
Tableau

## Project Overview

For this analysis, Pandas was used to change the trip-duration column from an integer to a DateTime datatype. Then, using the converted data, create a set of visualizations to show the length of time bikes are checked out for all riders and genders; show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week. Finally, indicate the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.
